    "This tutorial consists of two data explorations. The first uses data that is relatively similar to the data in the lecture notes and examples. The second is more unstructured and open ended.\n",

    "**Notebooks**: We will be using Colab to create Python Notebooks on your Google Drive although you may also use Jupyter. Read the document Tutorials.pdf from Moodle to see how to set these up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming**: For each exploration you should create a notebook and save it when you have finished. You should name the two notebooks Tut06-A.ipynb and Tut06-B.ipynb. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Every numbered item in the exploration should have a code section and a markdown section underneath where you discuss your findings. There should also be a code section at the top of the Notebook with the imports.\n"
